# [MOSQUITO BITE PREDICTOR] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [GALACTOSE]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [AMRUTHA] - [COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING PALAKKAD]
- Member 1: [AMEGH T K] - [COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING PALAKKAD]

### Project Description
[Predict chances for getting mosquito bites based on certain factors.Factors selected for predicting the probability are blood group,climate,time of a day,colour of your cloth,body condition]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Probability of getting mosquito bites]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We predicted the mosquito biting prbability by comparing each factors responsible for the bite!]
